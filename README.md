## Program Description:

This project takes a date and time range before redirecting the user to sign into their google account. We then use their google calendar information to find out when they are 'busy' between the target date and time range. The client then prints out the events where the user is 'busy' within the time range, accounting for transparent events as well. I also humanized the dates similar to project 6 so that it says their event is in x amount of days as well as the date in ISO form.
